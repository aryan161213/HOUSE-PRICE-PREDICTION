# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION
The real estate sector is a vital component of the economy, yet both buyers and sellers often face challenges in determining fair property values due to market volatility. This project aims to develop a predictive model utilizing machine learning techniques to estimate house prices based on various key features, including location, size, and amenities. The dataset employed for this analysis is the Boston House Pricing dataset, maintained by Carnegie Mellon University and freely available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 506 observations across 14 attributes. Through data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, significant relationships between features and house prices are identified. Various algorithms, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, are evaluated for their predictive accuracy. The results indicate that [highlight any significant findings, such as the best-performing model or important features], providing stakeholders with a reliable tool for informed decision-making in the real estate market. This model not only enhances market transparency but also supports improved investment strategies in the housing sector.
